   - Both Stripe and Cashfree webhook handlers

### ‚úÖ Frontend Components

1. **Admin Panel**
   - Enhanced `PaymentGatewaysTab.tsx` with health status indicators
   - Enable/disable toggles for each gateway
   - Real-time configuration management
   - Test connectivity functionality

2. **User-Facing Payment**
   - Updated `CreditsPage.tsx` with dynamic gateway selection
   - New `CashfreePaymentForm.tsx` component for Indian payments
   - Automatic gateway availability detection
   - Multi-currency support (USD/INR)

## üîß Configuration Requirements

### 1. Stripe Configuration
Navigate to Admin Panel > Payment Gateways and configure:
```json
{
  "secret_key": "sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key",
  "publishable_key": "pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key",
  "webhook_secret": "whsec_your_webhook_secret"
}
```

### 2. Cashfree Configuration
Navigate to Admin Panel > Payment Gateways and configure:
```json
{
  "app_id": "your_cashfree_app_id",
  "secret_key": "your_cashfree_secret_key",
  "is_test_mode": true
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Step 1: Database Setup
```bash
# Run the migration (already completed)
cd backend
node migrations/setup_payment_gateways.js
```

### Step 2: Admin Panel Testing
1. Navigate to Admin Panel > Payment Gateways
2. Verify both Stripe and Cashfree are listed as INACTIVE
3. Configure Stripe credentials:
   - Add your test secret key (sk_test_...)
   - Add your test publishable key (pk_test_...)
   - Add webhook secret (whsec_...)
4. Click "Enable" to activate Stripe
5. Use "Test" button to verify connectivity
6. Repeat for Cashfree with sandbox credentials

### Step 3: Frontend Payment Testing
1. Navigate to Credits page as a regular user
2. Verify the "Payment Gateway Selection" section appears
3. Check that only enabled gateways are shown
4. Test purchasing credits with each gateway:
   - **Stripe**: Use card 4242424242424242, any future date, any CVC
   - **Cashfree**: Will redirect to sandbox payment page

### Step 4: Webhook Testing
1. **Stripe Webhooks**:
   - Set endpoint: `your_domain/api/payments/webhook`
   - Enable: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`

2. **Cashfree Webhooks**:
   - Set endpoint: `your_domain/api/payments/cashfree/webhook`
   - Enable payment success, failure, and cancellation events
